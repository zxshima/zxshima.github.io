  // tips : a spread factor can be a decimal number (such as 1.5)
  //        a spread factor of 1 means all structure's placement are not modified (useful if you want to use only custom spread factors)
  //        a spread factor above 1 means all structures are rarer
  //        a spread factor below 1 means all structure are more common
